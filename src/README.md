## Title
Final Phase 2 Project
Shopping App

## Description
This is my final phase 2 project "README" file showing how i did the project.

In the project I made the cart and all the functionalities except the buy button which has no functions yet.

I have also made the funtions of the like button together with the add to cart batton. 

Most of the styling of the project is also done by me and i a have used bootstrap as a styling extension on most of the features of the app together with the in built CSS.

Lastly i have done the "ABOUT US" which is at the bottom of the home page.
